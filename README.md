## Sunset/Sunrise Map

The goal of this exercise is to create a page with a map view, which should allow the user to click on any location and
show a popup with sunrise/sunset/day length informations related to that set of coordinates.
There is a public API here https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/Szf7znEe#68b4b47b-d123-4fe2-bfe0-c8e1cb623146
which will provide this information.

A bonus feature would be showing in the popup the location's country/flag (where possible).

Map view can be implemented in any preferred way
